  abstract = {With the ability to move virtual machines between physical hosts, live migration is a core feature of virtualisation. However for migration to be useful, deployable feature on a large (datacentre) scale, we need to predict migration times with accuracy. In this paper, we characterise the parameters affecting live migration with particular emphasis on the Xen virtualisation platform. We discuss the relationships between the important parameters that affect migration and highlight how migration performance can vary considerably depending on workload. We further provide 2 simulation models that are able to predict migration times to within 90\% accuracy for both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.},

Originally motivated by Web 2.0 applications, these systems are designed to scale to thousands or millions of users doing updates as well as reads, in contrast to traditional DBMSs and data warehouses. We contrast the new systems on their data model, consistency mechanisms, storage mechanisms, durability guarantees, availability, query support, and other dimensions. These systems typically sacrifice some of these dimensions, e.g. database-wide transaction consistency, in order to achieve others, e.g. higher availability and scalability.},

  abstract = {We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of post-copy based live migration for virtual machines (VMs) across a Gigabit LAN. Post-copy migration defers the transfer of a VM's memory contents until after its processor state has been sent to the target host. This deferral is in contrast to the traditional pre-copy approach, which first copies the memory state over multiple iterations followed by a final transfer of the processor state. The post-copy strategy can provide a "win-win" by reducing total migration time while maintaining the liveness of the VM during migration. We compare post-copy extensively against the traditional pre-copy approach on the Xen Hypervisor. Using a range of VM workloads we show that post-copy improves several metrics including pages transferred, total migration time, and network overhead. We facilitate the use of post-copy with adaptive prepaging techniques to minimize the number of page faults across the network. We propose different prepaging strategies and quantitatively compare their effectiveness in reducing network-bound page faults. Finally, we eliminate the transfer of free memory pages in both pre-copy and post-copy through a dynamic self-ballooning (DSB) mechanism. DSB periodically reclaims free pages from a VM and significantly speeds up migration with negligible performance impact on VM workload.},

  abstract = {When users flood in cloud data centers, how to efficiently manage hardware resources and Virtual Machines (VMs) in a data center to both lower economical cost and ensure a high service quality becomes an inevitable work for cloud providers. VM migration is a cornerstone technology for the majority of cloud management tasks. It frees a VM from the underlying hardware. This feature brings a plenty of benefits to cloud providers and users. Many researchers are focusing on pushing its cutting edge. In this paper, we firstly give an overview of VM migration and discuss both its benefits and challenges. VM migration schemes are classified from three perspectives: manner, distance, and granularity. The studies on non-live migration are simply reviewed, and then those on live migration are comprehensively surveyed based on the three main challenges it faces: memory data migration, storage data migration, and network connection continuity. The works on quantitative analysis of VM migration performance are also elaborated. With the development and evolution of cloud computing, user mobility becomes an important motivation for live VM migration in some scenarios (e.g., fog computing). Thus, the studies regarding linking VM migration to user mobility are summarized as well. At last, we list the open issues which are waiting for solutions or further optimizations on live VM migration.},
