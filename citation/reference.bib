Due to their popularity, it exploits the attack surface, because the Hypervisor code contains much vulnerability. Since the Hypervisor is a core element of any cloud computing service, it is always on the top priority of the attackers. There are many Software (open source) and Hardware-based Solutions are available in the market to monitor and control the hypervisor activities.

However, for wide-area network (WAN) migration it is crucial to not just transfer the VMs image but also transfer its local persistent state (its file system) and its on-going network connections. In this paper we address both: by combining a blocklevel solution with pre-copying and write throttling we show that we can transfer an entire running web server, including its local persistent state, with minimal disruption — three seconds in the LAN and 68 seconds in the WAN); by combining dynDNS with tunneling, existing connections can continue transparently while new ones are redirected to the new network location. Thus we show experimentally that by combining well-known techniques in a novel manner we can provide system support for migrating virtual execution environments in the wide area.},

This work evaluates the top three open-source NoSQL document databases: Couchbase, CouchDB, and MongoDB with Yahoo!

The performance and scale-up of document databases are assessed using YCSB workloads with a different number of records and threads, where the runtime is measured for each database. In the experimental evaluation, we concluded that MongoDB is the database with the best runtime, except for the workload composed by scan operations. In addition, we identified CouchDB as the database with the best scale-up when varying the number of threads.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in virtualisation technology have resulted in its proliferation of usage across datacentres. Ultimately, the goal of this technology is to more efficiently utilise server resources to reduce Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by abstracting hardware and consolidating servers. This results in lower equipment costs and less electrical consumption for server power and cooling. However, the TCO benefits of holistic virtualisation extend beyond server assets. One of these aspects relates to the ability of being able to migrate Virtual Machines (VM) across distinct physical hosts over a network. However, limitations of the current migration technology start to appear when they are applied on larger application systems such as SAP ERP or SAP ByDesign. Such systems consume a large amount of memory and cannot be transferred as seamlessly as smaller ones, creating service interruption. Limiting the impact and optimising migration becomes even more important with the generalisation of Service Level Agreement (SLA). In this document we present our design and evaluation of a system that enables live migration of VMs running large enterprise applications without severely disrupting their live services, even across the Internet. By combining well-known techniques and innovative ones we can reduce system down-time and resource impact for migrating live, large Virtual Execution Environments.},

  abstract = {We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of post-copy based live migration for virtual machines (VMs) across a Gigabit LAN. Post-copy migration defers the transfer of a VM's memory contents until after its processor state has been sent to the target host. This deferral is in contrast to the traditional pre-copy approach, which first copies the memory state over multiple iterations followed by a final transfer of the processor state. The post-copy strategy can provide a "win-win" by reducing total migration time while maintaining the liveness of the VM during migration. We compare post-copy extensively against the traditional pre-copy approach on the Xen Hypervisor. Using a range of VM workloads we show that post-copy improves several metrics including pages transferred, total migration time, and network overhead. We facilitate the use of post-copy with adaptive prepaging techniques to minimize the number of page faults across the network. We propose different prepaging strategies and quantitatively compare their effectiveness in reducing network-bound page faults. Finally, we eliminate the transfer of free memory pages in both pre-copy and post-copy through a dynamic self-ballooning (DSB) mechanism. DSB periodically reclaims free pages from a VM and significantly speeds up migration with negligible performance impact on VM workload.},

  abstract = {Live migration of virtual machines (VMs) can consume excessive time and resources, and may affect application performance significantly if VM memory pages get dirtied faster than their content can be transferred to the destination. Existing approaches to this problem transfer memory content faster with high-speed networks, slow down the dirtying of memory pages by throttling the execution of applications, or reduce the amount of memory content to be transferred, for example, using compression. However, these approaches incur high resource costs or application performance penalties. In this paper, we propose to skip the transfer of VM memory pages that need not be migrated for the execution of running applications at the destination, by exploiting applications’ assistance. We have designed a generic framework for application-assisted live migration and then used it to build and evaluate JAVMM, which migrates VMs running various types of Java applications skipping the transfer of garbage in Java memory. Our experimental results show that JAVMM can reduce the completion time, the network traffic of transferring memory pages, and the application downtime of Java VM migration, all by up to over 90\%, compared to the vanilla Xen VM migration, without incurring noticeable performance penalty to applications.},

We show that due to a high rate of memory changes, the current KVM rate control and target downtime heuristics do not cope well with HPC applications: statically choosing rate limits and downtimes is infeasible and current mechanisms sometimes provide suboptimal performance. We present a novel on-line algorithm able to provide minimal downtime and minimal impact on end-to-end application performance.

  abstract = {Live migration has been proposed to reduce the downtime for migrated VMs by pre-copying the generated run-time memory state files from the original host to the migration destination host. However, if the rate for such a dirty memory generation is high, it may take a long time to accomplish live migration because a large amount of data needs to be transferred. In extreme cases when dirty memory generation rate is faster than pre-copy speed, live migration will fail. In this work we address the problem by designing an optimization scheme for live migration, under which according to precopy speed, the VCPU working frequency may be reduced so that at a certain phase of the pre-copy the remaining dirty memory can reach a desired small amount. The VM downtime during the migration can be limited. The scheme works for the scenario where the migrated application has a high memory writing speed, or the pre-copy speed is slow, e.g., due to low network bandwidth between the migration parties. The method improves migration liveness at the cost of application performance, and works for those applications for which interruption causes much more serious problems than quality deterioration. Compared to the original live migration, our experiments show that the optimized scheme can reduce up to 88\% of application downtime with an acceptable overhead.},

Google’s VMs run on top of rapidly changing infrastructure: we regularly update hardware and host software, and we must quickly respond to failing hardware. Frequent change is critical to both development velocity—deploying new versions of services and infrastructure—and the ability to respond rapidly to defects, including critical security fixes. Typically these updates would be disruptive, resulting in VM termination or restart. In this paper we present how we use VM live migration at scale to eliminate this disruption with minimal impact to the guest, performing over 1,000,0001migrations monthly in our production fleet, with 50ms median blackout, 300ms 99th percentile blackout.},

  abstract = {Despite the widespread support for live migration of Virtual Machines (VMs) in current hypervisors, these have significant shortcomings when it comes to migration of certain types of VMs. More specifically, with existing algorithms, there is a high risk of service interruption when migrating VMs with high workloads and/or over low-bandwidth networks. In these cases, VM memory pages are dirtied faster than they can be transferred over the network, which leads to extended migration downtime. In this contribution, we study the application of delta compression during the transfer of memory pages in order to increase migration throughput and thus reduce downtime. The delta compression live migration algorithm is implemented as a modification to the KVM hypervisor. Its performance is evaluated by migrating VMs running different type of workloads and the evaluation demonstrates a significant decrease in migration downtime in all test cases. In a benchmark scenario the downtime is reduced by a factor of 100. In another scenario a streaming video server is live migrated with no perceivable downtime to the clients while the picture is frozen for eight seconds using standard approaches. Finally, in an enterprise application scenario, the delta compression algorithm successfully live migrates a very large system that fails after migration using the standard algorithm. Finally, we discuss some general effects of delta compression on live migration and analyze when it is beneficial to use this technique.},

These non-functional aspects are the main reason for using NoSQL database. However, currently there are no systematic studies on data modeling for NoSQL databases, especially the document-oriented ones. Therefore, this article proposes a NoSQL data modeling standard in the form of ER diagrams, introducing modeling techniques that can be used on documentoriented databases. On the other hand the purpose of this article is not structure the data using the model proposed, but it does helping with the visualization of data. In addition, to validate the proposed model, a study case was implemented using genomic data.},

Sandpiper implements a black-box approach that is fully OS- and application-agnostic and a gray-box approach that exploits OS- and application-level statistics. We implement our techniques in Xen and conduct a detailed evaluation using a mix of CPU, network and memory-intensive applications. Our results show that Sandpiper is able to resolve single server hotspots within 20 seconds and scales well to larger, data center environments. We also show that the gray-box approach can help Sandpiper make more informed decisions, particularly in response to memory pressure.},

  abstract = {When users flood in cloud data centers, how to efficiently manage hardware resources and Virtual Machines (VMs) in a data center to both lower economical cost and ensure a high service quality becomes an inevitable work for cloud providers. VM migration is a cornerstone technology for the majority of cloud management tasks. It frees a VM from the underlying hardware. This feature brings a plenty of benefits to cloud providers and users. Many researchers are focusing on pushing its cutting edge. In this paper, we firstly give an overview of VM migration and discuss both its benefits and challenges. VM migration schemes are classified from three perspectives: manner, distance, and granularity. The studies on non-live migration are simply reviewed, and then those on live migration are comprehensively surveyed based on the three main challenges it faces: memory data migration, storage data migration, and network connection continuity. The works on quantitative analysis of VM migration performance are also elaborated. With the development and evolution of cloud computing, user mobility becomes an important motivation for live VM migration in some scenarios (e.g., fog computing). Thus, the studies regarding linking VM migration to user mobility are summarized as well. At last, we list the open issues which are waiting for solutions or further optimizations on live VM migration.},
