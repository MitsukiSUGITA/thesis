abstract = {Existing operating systems share a common kernel text section amongst all processes. It is not possible to perform kernel specialization or tuning such that different applications execute text optimized for their kernel use despite the benefits of kernel specialization for performance guided optimization, exokernels, kernel fastpaths, and cheaper hardware access. Current specialization primitives involve system wide changes to kernel text, which can have adverse effects on other processes sharing the kernel due to the global side-effects. We present shadow kernels: a primitive that allows multiple kernel text sections to coexist in a contemporary operating system. By remapping kernel virtual memory on a context-switch, or for individual system calls, we specialize the kernel on a fine-grained basis. Our implementation of shadow kernels uses the Xen hypervisor so can be applied to any operating system that runs on Xen.},

abstract = {Stateful middleboxes, such as intrusion detection systems and application-level firewalls, have provided key func-tionalities in operating modern IP networks. However, designing an efficient middlebox is challenging due to the lack of networking stack abstraction for TCP flow processing. Thus, middlebox developers often write the complex flow management logic from scratch, which is not only prone to errors, but also wastes efforts for similar functionalities across applications. This paper presents the design and implementation of mOS, a reusable networking stack for stateful flow pro-cessing in middlebox applications. Our API allows de-velopers to focus on the core application logic instead of dealing with low-level packet/flow processing them-selves. Under the hood, it implements an efficient event system that scales to monitoring millions of concurrent flow events. Our evaluation demonstrates that mOS en-ables modular development of stateful middleboxes, often significantly reducing development efforts represented by the source lines of code, while introducing little perfor-mance overhead in multi-10Gbps network environments.},

abstract = {近年仮想化された CPU やメモリ,ストレージのような計算資源を提供する IaaS 型クラウ ドプラットフォームとが増加している.この形のプラットフォームの利点のひとつに,ユー ザの要求に応じて計算資源の増減が即座に可能であることが挙げられる.また,クラウドプ ラットフォームには PaaS 型と呼ばれるアプリケーションを配置するだけでサービスを提供 できる環境が存在している. PaaS 型の利便性と IaaS 型の利便性を共に備える存在として,コンテナ仮想化を利用した クラウドプラットフォームが出現している.しかし,コンテナ仮想化に存在する計算資源管 理機構が重複し無駄が発生するという問題点が存在する.これを解決する技術としてライブ ラリ OS が挙げられる. ライブラリ OS の登場により, IaaS 型においても大量のアプリケーションが動作する汎用 OS を仮想化するのではなく,アプリケーションごとに仮想化し協調させて動作させるよう な使い方が増加すると考えられる.しかし,そのようなクラウドプラットフォームはまだ存 在しない. そこで本報告では,ライブラリ OS 同様に軽量な仮想化インスタンスの初期化時間を計測 することで,ライブラリ OS を用いるクラウドプラットフォーム上でのインスタンスの初期 化・起動の設計について検討する.クラウドサービスプロバイダが使用する, 1 台あたり数 コア {\&}{\#}8211; 十数コアの CPU をもつコモディティなサーバの上において,仮想化したインスタンス を起動する場合,特に数秒の間に数百 {\&}{\#}8211; 数千台を起動するバースト起動について計測した. ( 1 )起動するインスタンスに割り当てるメモリの上限( 2 )起動するインスタンスの台数( 3 ) 個々のインスタンスの起動の間隔時間,の 3 つの項について変化させ,それぞれが初期化時 間に与える影響を分析した. 計測の結果より, ( 1 )は初期化時間に対してほぼ影響しないことが判明した.( 2 )では要 求台数を 2 回に分け起動した場合と要求台数を起動した場合に,要求台数の初期化に要する 時間は後者のほうが小さいことがわかった. ( 3 )について,起動の間隔を大きくする場合に おいても同じ台数ならば全ての初期化が終了する時刻は大きく変化しなかった.しかし最初 に初期化が終わったインスタンスの初期化終了時刻は起動の間隔が大きいほうが 1 秒–10 秒 程度早くなるという事実が判明した. 以上の事実からライブラリ OS を前提とするクラウドプラットフォームの設計について, ユーザ要求はある程度まとめて処理し,起動の間隔を起動するプログラムのサイズに応じて 大きくするようなスケジューリングが必要であると考えられる. Nowadays, IaaS is a popular platform of cloud computing that provides virtual computational resources such as CPU, memory and storage. An advantage of IaaS is immediately increase and decrease of resources on demand. PaaS is also a major cloud computing platform that allows developers to provide a service easily by just deploying an application. However, PaaS cannot increase resources immediately. A cloud platform that utilizes container based virtualization is remarkable because it provides the convenience of both IaaS and PaaS. However, using container on IaaS, we face a redundancy of two resource managers: hypervisor and supervisor. Library OS is one of solutions for addressing the redundancy. Library OS changes a trend of virtualization of IaaS, from virtualizing large general OS to virtualizing and combining small applications. Nevertheless, no cloud platform supports library OS currently. In this report, through measuring the initialization time of lightweight virtualized instances, I investigate a strategy for initialization of a lot of instances on the cloud computing platform using Library OS. I analyze the behavior of the initialization from the following three viewpoints in case of booting from hundreds to thousands virtualized instances in several seconds on a server which has a dozen of cores: (1)the limits of allocated memory for each instance, (2)the number of instances to boot, (3)an interval of the instances. Experimental results shows that (1) did not affect the initialization time. In case of (2), the initialization time of booting all the instances at once was smaller than the total of the initialization time at twice. In case of (3), a large interval did not increase the total of initialization time of the same number of instances, while it reduces the initialization time of the first instance. Thus, I suggest a scheduling system for the cloud computing platform using Library OS such that it manages multiple requests together on demand and controls an interval of booting instances depending on program size.},

abstract = {It is challenging to simultaneously achieve multicore scala- bility and high disk throughput in a file system. For exam- ple, even for commutative operations like creating different files in the same directory, current file systems introduce cache-line conflicts when updating an in-memory copy of the on-disk directory block, which limits scalability. ScaleFS is a novel file system design that decouples the in-memory file system from the on-disk file system using per-core operation logs. This design facilitates the use of highly concurrent data structures for the in-memory repre- sentation, which allows commutative operations to proceed without cache conflicts and hence scale perfectly. ScaleFS logs operations in a per-core log so that it can delay propa- gating updates to the disk representation (and the cache-line conflicts involved in doing so) until an fsync. The fsync call merges the per-core logs and applies the operations to disk. ScaleFS uses several techniques to perform the merge correctly while achieving good performance: timestamped linearization points to order updates without introducing cache-line conflicts, absorption of logged operations, and dependency tracking across operations. Experiments with a prototype of ScaleFS show that its implementation has no cache conflicts for 99{\%} of test cases of commutative operations generated by Commuter, scales well on an 80-core machine, and provides on-disk perfor- mance that is comparable to that of Linux ext4.},

We argue that, in such an environment, the underlying resources should be exposed directly to applications without kernel or hypervisor involvement. We propose the nonkernel, an architecture for operating system kernel construction designed for such cloud computing platforms. A nonkernel uses modern architectural support for machine virtualization to securely provide unprivileged user programs with pervasive access to the underlying resources. We motivate the need for the nonkernel, we contrast it against its predecessor the exokernel, and we outline how one could go about building a nonkernel operating system.},

It addresses the duplication issues by using a low- overhead library-OS-like design. It runs existing appli- cations written for Linux, as well as new applications written for OSv. We demonstrate that OSv is able to effi- ciently run a variety of existing applications. We demon- strate its sub-second boot time, small OS image and how it makes more memory available to the application. For unmodified network-intensive applications, we demon- strate up to 25{\%} increase in throughput and 47{\%} de- crease in latency. By using non-POSIX network APIs, we can further improve performance and demonstrate a 290{\%} increase in Memcached throughput.},

A thorough understanding of these characteristics can inform the providers' resource manage- ment systems, e.g. VM scheduler, power manager, server health manager. In this paper, we first introduce an exten- sive characterization of Microsoft Azure's VM workload, including distributions of the VMs' lifetime, deployment size, and resource consumption.We then show that certain VM behaviors are fairly consistent over multiple lifetimes, i.e. history is an accurate predictor of future behavior. Based on this observation, we next introduce Resource Central (RC), a system that collects VM telemetry, learns these behaviors offline, and provides predictions online to various resource managers via a general client-side library. As an example of RC's online use,wemodify Azure'sVMscheduler to leverage predictions in oversubscribing servers (with oversubscrib- ableVMtypes), while retaining highVMperformance. Using real VM traces, we then show that the prediction-informed schedules increase utilization and prevent physical resource exhaustion. We conclude that providers can exploit their workloads' characteristics and machine learning to improve resource management substantially.},

KVM/ARM introduces split-mode virtualization, allowing a hypervisor to split its execution across CPU modes and be integrated into the Linux kernel. This allows KVM/ARM to leverage existing Linux hardware support and functionality to simplify hypervisor development and maintainability while utilizing recent ARM hardware virtualization extensions to run virtual machines with comparable performance to native execution. KVM/ARM has been successfully merged into the mainline Linux kernel, ensuring that it will gain wide adoption as the virtualization platform of choice for ARM. We provide the first measurements on real hardware of a complete hypervisor using ARM hardware virtualization support. Our results demonstrate that KVM/ARM has modest virtualization performance and power costs, and can achieve lower performance and power costs compared to x86-based Linux virtualization on multicore hardware.},

abstract = {The hybrid runtime (HRT) model offers a path towards high performance and efficiency. By integrating the OS kernel, runtime, and application, an HRT allows the runtime developer to leverage the full feature set of the hardware and specialize OS services to the runtime's needs. However, conforming to the HRT model currently requires a port of the runtime to the kernel level, for example to the Nautilus kernel framework, and this requires knowledge of kernel internals. In response, we developed Multiverse, a system that bridges the gap between a built-from-scratch HRT and a legacy runtime system. Multiverse allows unmodified applications and runtimes to be brought into the HRT model without any porting effort whatsoever by splitting the execution of the application between the domains of a legacy OS and an HRT environment. We describe the design and implementation of Multiverse and illustrate its capabilities using the massive, widely-used Racket runtime system.},

abstract = {Despite the fact that large-scale shared-memory multiprocessors have been commercially available for several years, system software that fully utilizes all their features is still not available, mostly due to the complexity and cost of making the required changes to the operating system. A recently proposed approach, called Disco, substantially reduces this development cost by using a virtual machine monitor that laverages the existing operating system technology. In this paper we present a system called Cellular Disco that extends the Disco work to provide all the advantages of the hardware partitioning and scalable operating system approaches. We argue that Cellular Disco can achieve these benefits at only a small fraction of the development cost of modifying the operating system. Cellular Disco effectively turns a large-scale shared-memory multiprocessor into a virtual cluster that supports fault containment and heterogeneity, while avoiding operating system scalability bottlenecks. Yet at the same time, Cellular Disco preserves the benefits of a shared-memory multiprocessor by implementing dynamic, fine-grained resource sharing, and by allowing users to overcommit resources such as processors and memory. This hybrid approach requires a scalable resource manager that makes local decisions with limited information while still providing good global performance and fault containment. In this paper we describe our experience with a Cellular Disco prototype on a 32-processor SGI Origin 2000 system. We show that the execution time penalty for this approach is low, typically within 10{\%} of the best available commercial operating system formost workloads, and that it can manage the CPU and memory resources of the machine significantly better than the hardware partitioning approach.},

abstract = {The File System, or BetrFS, (pronounced “better eff ess”) is the first in-kernel file system to use a write-optimized index. Write optimized indexes (WOIs) are promising building blocks for storage systems be- cause of their potential to implement both microwrites and large scans efficiently. Previous work on WOI-based file systems has shown promise but has also been hampered by several open problems, which this paper addresses. For example, FUSE issues many queries into the file system, su- perimposing read-intensive workloads on top of write- intensive ones, thereby reducing the effectiveness of WOIs. Moving to an in-kernel implementation can ad- dress this problem by providing finer control of reads. This paper also contributes several implementation tech- niques to leverage kernel infrastructure without throttling write performance. Our results show that BetrFS provides good perfor- mance for both arbitrary microdata operations, which in- clude creating small files, updating metadata, and small writes into large or small files, and for large sequen- tial I/O. On one microdata benchmark, BetrFS pro- vides more than 4× the performance of ext4 or XFS. BetrFS is an ongoing prototype effort, and requires ad- ditional data-structure tuning to match current general- purpose file systems on some operations such as deletes, directory renames, and large sequential writes. Nonethe- less, many applications realize significant performance improvements. For instance, an in-place rsync of the Linux kernel source realizes roughly 1.6–22× speedup over other commodity file systems.},

abstract = {Code is code. In the entire application stack only a very small fraction of code is special in the sense that it re- quires the hardware to run in privileged mode. In theory all the rest can run in either the kernel or user domain, with the tradeoffs being well-known. Engineering an operating system core so that the same code can function both in user and kernel mode alike pro- vides numerous benefits: testing and development, virtu- alization, stability and reusability of code in applications. In the current Unix style, code is divided to kernel code and userspace code. Although some limited code modules, such as byte order and address translation rou- tines may be shared, functionality at large is not available in both domains. This paper discusses the nuts and bolts of running the BSD networking code in userspace. It does not advo- cate turning BSD into a microkernel operating system, but rather gives concrete level proof that the kernel net- working stack and kernel networking applications can be run in userspace. The virtual userspace networking stack is measured to be performant enough to be able to satu- rate a regular network and to be over 10 times faster than the kernel networking stack running in a machine emu- lator. An implementation for NetBSD available from the NetBSD source repository is discussed.},

Jitk is a new infrastructure for building in-kernel interpreters that guarantee functional correctness as they compile user-space policies down to native instructions for execution in the kernel. To demonstrate Jitk, we implement two interpreters in the Linux kernel, BPF and INET-DIAG, which are used for network and system call filtering and socket monitoring, respectively. To help application developers write correct filters, we introduce a high-level rule language, along with a proof that Jitk correctly translates high-level rules all the way to native machine code, and demonstrate that this language can be integrated into OpenSSH with tens of lines of code. We built a prototype of Jitk on top of the CompCert verified compiler and integrated it into the Linux kernel. Experimental results show that Jitk is practical, fast, and trustworthy.},

Adding fine-grained access control improves the expressiveness, but often dramatically increases both the cost of system management and implementation complexity. In environments with a more complex man- agement model, with delegation of some management functions to par- ties under varying degrees of trust, the base UNIX model and most natu- ral extensions are inappropriate at best. Where multiple mutually un- trusting parties are introduced, ‘‘inappropriate'' rapidly transitions to ‘‘nightmarish'', especially with regards to data integrity and privacy pro- tection. The FreeBSD ‘‘Jail'' facility provides the ability to partition the operat- ing system environment, while maintaining the simplicity of the UNIX ‘‘root'' model. In Jail, users with privilege find that the scope of their requests is limited to the jail, allowing system administrators to delegate management capabilities for each virtual machine environment. Creating virtual machines in this manner has many potential uses; the most popu- lar thus far has been for providing virtual machine services in Internet Service Provider environments.},

abstract = {Abstract Modern Cloud Data Centers exploit virtualization for efficient resource management to reduce cloud computational cost and energy budget. Virtualization empowered by virtual machine (VM) migration meets the ever increasing demands of dynamic workload by relocating VMs within Cloud Data Centers. VM migration helps successfully achieve various resource management objectives such as load balancing, power management, fault tolerance, and system maintenance. However, being resource-intensive, the VM migration process rigorously affects application performance unless attended by smart optimization methods. Furthermore, a Cloud Data Centre exploits server consolidation and DVFS methods to optimize energy consumption. This paper reviews state-of-the-art bandwidth optimization schemes, server consolidation frameworks, DVFS-enabled power optimization, and storage optimization methods over WAN links. Through a meticulous literature review of state-of-the-art live VM migration schemes, thematic taxonomies are proposed to categorize the reported literature. The critical aspects of virtual machine migration schemes are investigated through a comprehensive analysis of the existing schemes. The commonalties and differences among existing VM migration schemes are highlighted through a set of parameters derived from the literature. Finally, open research issues and trends in the VM migration domain that necessitate further consideration to develop optimal VM migration schemes are highlighted.},

abstract = {In this paper we advocate that it is time for a radical rethinking of database systems design. Developers should be able to leverage high-level programming languages without having to pay a price in efficiency. To realize our vision of abstraction without regret, we present LegoBase, a query engine written in the high-level pro- gramming language Scala. The key technique to regain efficiency is to apply generative programming: the Scala code that constitutes the query engine, despite its high-level appearance, is actually a program generator that emits specialized, low-level C code. We show how the combination of high-level and generative program- ming allows to easily implement a wide spectrum of optimizations that are difficult to achieve with existing low-level query compilers, and how it can continuously optimize the query engine. We evaluate our approach with the TPC-H benchmark and show that: (a) with all optimizations enabled, our architecture signifi- cantly outperforms a commercial in-memory database system as well as an existing query compiler, (b) these performance improve- ments require programming just a few hundred lines of high-level code instead of complicated low-level code that is required by exist- ing query compilers and, finally, that (c) the compilation overhead is low compared to the overall execution time, thus making our ap- proach usable in practice for efficiently compiling query engines.},

abstract = {Linux{\textregistered}, or more specifically, the Linux API, plays a key role in HPC computing. Even for extreme-scale computing, a known and familiar API is required for production machines. However, an off-the-shelf Linux distribution faces challenges at extreme scale. To date, two approaches have been used to address the challenges of providing an operating system (OS) at extreme scale. In the Full-Weight Kernel (FWK) approach, an OS, typically Linux, forms the starting point, and work is undertaken to remove features from the environment so that it will scale up across more cores and out across a large cluster. A Light-Weight Kernel (LWK) approach often starts with a new kernel and work is undertaken to add functionality to provide a familiar API, typically Linux. Either approach however, results in an execution environment that is not fully Linux compatible. mOS (multi Operating System) runs both an FWK (Linux), and an LWK, simultaneously as kernels on the same compute node. mOS thereby achieves the scalability and reliability of LWKs, while providing the full Linux functionality of an FWK. Further, mOS works in concert with Operating System Nodes (OSNs) to offload system calls, e.g., I/O, that are too invasive to run on the compute nodes at extreme-scale. Beyond providing full Linux capability with LWK performance, other advantages of mOS include the ability to effectively manage different types of compute and memory resources, interface easily with proposed asynchronous and fine-grained runtimes, and nimbly manage new technologies. This paper is an architectural description of mOS. As a prototype is not yet finished, the contributions of this work are a description of mOS's architecture, an exploration of the tradeoffs and value of this approach for the purposes listed above, and a detailed architecture description of each of the six components of mOS, including the tradeoffs we considered. The uptick of OS research work indicates that many view this as an important area for getting to extreme scale. Thus, most importantly, the goal of the paper is to generate discussion in this area at the workshop.},

Libra provides the services necessary to achieve good performance for the Java workloads of interest but relies on an instance of Linux in another hypervisor partition to provide a networking stack, a filesystem, and other services. The expense of remote calls is offset by the fact that Libra's services can be customized for a particular workload; for example, on the Nutch search engine, we show that two simple customizations improve application throughput by a factor of 2.7.},

abstract = {Virtual Machine (VM) fork is a new cloud computing abstraction that instantaneously clones a VM into multiple replicas running on different hosts. All replicas share the same initial state, matching the intuitive semantics of stateful worker creation. VM fork thus enables the straightforward creation and efficient deployment of many tasks demanding swift instantiation of stateful workers in a cloud environment, e.g. excess load handling, opportunistic job placement, or parallel computing. Lack of instantaneous stateful cloning forces users of cloud computing into ad hoc practices to manage application state and cycle provisioning. We present SnowFlock, our implementation of the VM fork abstraction. To evaluate SnowFlock, we focus on the demanding scenario of services requiring on-the-fly creation of hundreds of parallel workers in order to solve computationally-intensive queries in seconds. These services are prominent in fields such as bioinformatics, finance, and rendering. SnowFlock provides sub-second VM cloning, scales to hundreds of workers, consumes few cloud I/O resources, and has negligible runtime overhead.},

abstract = {Monolithic operating system designs undermine the security of computing systems by allowing single exploits anywhere in the kernel to enjoy full supervisor privilege. The nested kernel operating system architecture addresses this problem by "nesting" a small isolated kernel within a traditional monolithic kernel. The "nested kernel" interposes on all updates to virtual memory translations to assert protections on physical memory, thus significantly reducing the trusted computing base for memory access control enforcement. We incorporated the nested kernel architecture into FreeBSD on x86-64 hardware while allowing the entire operating system, including untrusted components, to operate at the highest hardware privilege level by write-protecting MMU translations and de-privileging the untrusted part of the kernel. Our implementation inherently enforces kernel code integrity while still allowing dynamically loaded kernel modules, thus defending against code injection attacks. We also demonstrate that the nested kernel architecture allows kernel developers to isolate memory in ways not possible in monolithic kernels by introducing write-mediation and write-logging services to protect critical system data structures. Performance of the nested kernel prototype shows modest overheads: {\textless}1{\%} average for Apache and 2.7{\%} for kernel compile. Overall, our results and experience show that the nested kernel design can be retrofitted to existing monolithic kernels, providing important security benefits.},

We thenchronologically survey most of the literatureon allocators between 1961 and 1995.(Scores of papers are discussed, in varying detail, and over 150 references are given.) We argue that allocator designs have been unduly restricted by an emphasis on mechanism, rather than policy, while the latter is more important; higher-level strategic issues are still more important, but have not beengiven much attention. Most theoretical analyses and empirical allocator evaluations to date have relied on very strong assumptions of randomness and independence, but real program behavior exhibits important regularities that must be exploited if allocators are to perform well in practice.},

abstract = {Containers are in great demand because they are lightweight when compared to virtual machines. On the downside, con- tainers offer weaker isolation than VMs, to the point where people run containers in virtual machines to achieve proper isolation. In this paper, we examine whether there is indeed a strict tradeoff between isolation (VMs) and efficiency (con- tainers).We find that VMs can be as nimble as containers, as long as they are small and the toolstack is fast enough. We achieve lightweight VMs by using unikernels for spe- cialized applications and with Tinyx, a tool that enables creating tailor-made, trimmed-down Linux virtual machines. By themselves, lightweight virtual machines are not enough to ensure good performance since the virtualization control plane (the toolstack) becomes the performance bottleneck. We present LightVM, a new virtualization solution based on Xen that is optimized to offer fast boot-times regardless of the number of active VMs. LightVM features a complete redesign of Xen's control plane, transforming its centralized operation to a distributed one where interactions with the hypervisor are reduced to a minimum. LightVM can boot a VM in 2.3ms, comparable to fork/exec on Linux (1ms), and two orders of magnitude faster than Docker. LightVM can pack thousands of LightVM guests on modest hardware with memory and CPU usage comparable to that of processes.},

abstract = {Distributed storage systems are increasingly transition-ing to the use of erasure codes since they offer higher reliability at significantly lower storage costs than data replication. However, these codes tradeoff recovery per-formance as they require multiple disk reads and network transfers for reconstructing an unavailable data block. As a result, most existing systems use an erasure code either optimized for storage overhead or recovery performance. In this paper, we present HACFS, a new erasure-coded storage system that instead uses two different erasure codes and dynamically adapts to workload changes. It uses a fast code to optimize for recovery performance and a compact code to reduce the storage overhead. A novel conversion mechanism is used to efficiently up-code and downcode data blocks between fast and com-pact codes. We show that HACFS design techniques are generic and successfully apply it to two different code families: Product and LRC codes. We have implemented HACFS as an extension to the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and experimen-tally evaluate it with five different workloads from pro-duction clusters. The HACFS system always maintains a low storage overhead and significantly improves the re-covery performance as compared to three popular single-code storage systems. It reduces the degraded read la-tency by up to 46{\%}, and the reconstruction time and disk/network traffic by up to 45{\%}.},

Poptrie peaks between 174 and over 240 Million lookups per second (Mlps) with a single core and tables with 500--800k routes, consistently 4--578{\%} faster than all competing algorithms in all the tests we ran. We provide the comprehensive performance evaluation, remarkably with the CPU cycle analysis.

abstract = {Server virtualization technology facilitates the creation of an elastic computing infrastructure on demand. There are cloud applications like server-based computing and virtual desktop that concern startup latency and require impromptu requests for VM creation in a real-time manner. Conventional template-based VM creation is a time consuming process and lacks flexibility for the deployment of stateful VMs. In this paper, we present an abstraction of VM substrate to represent generic VM instances in miniature. Unlike templates that are stored as an image file in disk, VM substrates are docked in memory in a designated VM pool. They can be activated into stateful VMs without machine booting and application initialization. The abstraction leverages an arrange of techniques, including VM miniaturization, generalization, clone and migration, storage copy-on-write, and on-the-fly resource configuration, for rapid deployment of VMs and VM clusters on demand. We implement a prototype on a Xen platform and show that a server with typical configuration of TB disk and GB memory can accommodate more substrates in memory than templates in disk and stateful VMs can be created from the same or different substrates and deployed on to the same or different physical hosts in a cluster without causing any configuration conflicts. Experimental results show that general purpose VMs or a VM cluster for parallel computing can be deployed in a few seconds. We demonstrate the usage of VM substrates in a mobile gaming application.},

abstract = {We propose a deep learning method for single image super-resolution (SR). Our method directly learns an end-to-end mapping between the low/high-resolution images. The mapping is represented as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes the low-resolution image as the input and outputs the high-resolution one. We further show that traditional sparse-coding-based SR methods can also be viewed as a deep convolutional network. But unlike traditional methods that handle each component separately, our method jointly optimizes all layers. Our deep CNN has a lightweight structure, yet demonstrates state-of-the-art restoration quality, and achieves fast speed for practical on-line usage. We explore different network structures and parameter settings to achieve trade-offs between performance and speed. Moreover, we extend our network to cope with three color channels simultaneously, and show better overall reconstruction quality.},

In this paper we present an overview of both UVM and the BSD VM system. We focus our discussion on the design decisions made when creating UVM and contrast the UVM design with the less efficient BSD VM design. Topics covered include mapping, memory object management, anonymous memory and copy-on-write mechanisms, and pager design. We also present an overview of virtual memory based data movement mechanisms that have been introduced in BSD by UVM. We believe that the lessons we learned from designing and implementing UVM can be applied to other kernels and large software systems. Implemented in the NetBSD operating system, UVM will completely replace BSD VM in NetBSD 1.4.},

abstract = {OS-level virtualization generates a minimal start-up and run-time overhead on the host OS and thus suits applications that require both good isolation and high efficiency. However, multiple-member applications required for forming a system may need to occasionally communicate across this isolation barrier to cooperate with each other while they are separated in different VMs to isolate intrusion or fault. Such application scenarios are often critical to enterprise-class servers, HPC clusters and intrusion/fault-tolerant systems, etc. We make the first effort to support the inter-application interactions in an OS-level virtualization system without causing a significant compromise on VM isolation. We identify all interactive operations that impact inter-application interactions, including inter-process communications, application invocations, resource name transfers and application dependencies. We propose Shuttle, a novel approach for facilitating inter-application interactions within and across OS-level virtual machines. Our results demonstrate that Shuttle can correctly address all necessary inter-application interactions while providing good isolation capability to all sample applications on different versions of Windows OS.},

In this work, we present Tardigrade, a system that deploys an existing, unmodified binary as a fault-tolerant service. Tardigrade replicates the service on several machines so that it continues running even when some of them fail. Yet, it keeps the service states synchronized so clients see strongly consistent results. To achieve this efficiently, we use lightweight virtual machine replication. A lightweight virtual machine is a process sandboxed so that its external dependencies are completely encapsulated, enabling it to be migrated across machines. To let unmodified binaries run within such a sandbox, the sandbox also contains a library OS providing the expected API. We evaluate Tardigrade's performance and demonstrate its applicability to a variety of services, showing that it can convert these services into fault-tolerant ones transparently and efficiently.},

abstract = {Client software, such as Windows .exe files, poses security risks but also adds important functionality that cannot yet be replicated with web applications. These risks can be mitigated by running client software inside a sandbox. Virtual machines offer an easily deployed mechanism to create such a sandbox. This motivates two key questions: Are today's virtual machine mechanisms sufficient to prevent harm from malicious software? Even if they are sufficient, does it matter – is it the case that everyone has moved on to web applications? We address these questions by carrying out a survey of three populations of computer users: two within Microsoft and one drawn from U.S. users of the Amazon Mechanical Turk service. We note three key findings: First, all three populations download and run client software regularly: Over 70{\{}{\%}{\}} of respondents in all three popluations download and runs client software monthly or more often. Second, use of virtual machines for sandboxing is rare and inconsistently applied: 68{\{}{\%}{\}} of respondents in all three populations say they use virtual machines “occasionally” or less often. Third, of those who gave a reason for not using VMs, 44{\{}{\%}{\}} say it is “too hard.” We conclude that today's users are exposed to risk from client software and that today's sandboxing mechanisms are inadequate to protect them.},

We propose metrics for reasoning about the im-portance of various system APIs, including system calls, pseudo-files, and libc functions. Our metrics are designed for evaluating the relative maturity of a prototype system or compatibility layer, and this paper focuses on compatibility with Linux applications. This study uses a combination of static analysis to understand API usage and survey data to weight the relative importance of applications to end users. This paper yields several insights for developers and re-searchers, which are useful for assessing the complexity and security of Linux APIs. For example, every Ubuntu instal-lation requires 224 system calls, 208 ioctl, fcntl, and prctl codes and hundreds of pseudo files. For each API type, a significant number of APIs are rarely used, if ever. Moreover, several security-relevant API changes, such as re-placing access with faccessat, have met with slow adoption. Finally, hundreds of libc interfaces are effectively unused, yielding opportunities to improve security and effi-ciency by restructuring libc.},

abstract = {With increasing demand for big-data processing and faster in-memory databases, cloud providers are moving towards large virtualized instances besides focusing on the horizontal scalability. However, our experiments reveal that such instances in popular cloud services (e.g., 32 vCPUs with 208 GB supported by Google Compute Engine) do not achieve the desired scalability with increasing core count even with a simple, embarrassingly parallel job (e.g., Linux kernel compile). On a serious note, the internal synchronization scheme (e.g., paravirtualized ticket spinlock) of the virtualized instance on a machine with higher core count (e.g., 80-core) dramatically degrades its overall performance. Our finding is different from the previously well-known scalability problem (i.e., lock contention problem) and occurs because of the sophisticated optimization techniques implemented in the hypervisor---what we call sleepy spinlock anomaly. To solve this problem, we design and implement OTICKET, a variant of paravirtualized ticket spinlock that effectively scales the virtualized instances in both undersubscribed and oversubscribed environments.},

abstract = {Linux is a popular operating system (OS) as a production environment, while many developers prefer to use macOS for their daily development. One way to deal with this situation is running Linux in a virtual machine and the other is porting development environments from Linux to macOS. However, using a virtual machine has a resource sharing problem, and porting environments is costly and often incomplete. A promising approach to low-cost and seamless resource sharing is to develop a Linux compatibility layer for macOS. Unfortunately, existing methods of implementing OS compatibility layers lack robustness or flexibility. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of OS-compatibility layers. It allows user-space implementation of the core emulation layer in the host OS to improve robustness while maintaining the flexible and powerful emulation ability without heavily depending on the host OS kernel by exploiting virtualization technology.We implemented our approach and confirmed that Ubuntu's userland runs on macOS. Our experimental results show that our approach has reasonable performance for real world applications.},

abstract = {Videos are an increasingly utilized part of the experience of the billions of people that use Facebook. These videos must be uploaded and processed before they can be shared and downloaded. Uploading and processing videos at our scale, and across our many applications, brings three key requirements: lowlatency to support interactive applications; a flexible programming model for application developers that is simple to program, enables efficient processing, and improves reliability; and robustness to faults and overload. This paper describes the evolution fromour initial monolithic encoding script (MES) system to our current Streaming Video Engine (SVE) that overcomes each of the challenges. SVE has been in production since the fall of 2015, provides lower latency than MES, supports many diverse video applications, and has proven to be reliable despite faults and overload.},

This requires an embedded cloud platform on which to deploy multiple applications se-curely and quickly. We present Jitsu, a new Xen tool-stack that satisfies the demands of secure multi-tenant isolation on resource-constrained embedded ARM de-vices. It does this by using unikernels: lightweight, compact, single address space, memory-safe virtual ma-chines (VMs) written in a high-level language. Using fast shared memory channels, Jitsu provides a directory service that launches unikernels in response to network traffic and masks boot latency. Our evaluation shows Jitsu to be a power-efficient and responsive platform for hosting cloud services in the edge network while preserv-ing the strong isolation guarantees of a type-1 hypervisor.},

They are appropriate for many usage scenarios, but there are scenarios that require system virtualization with high degrees of both isolation and efficiency. Examples include HPC clusters, the Grid, hosting centers, and PlanetLab. We present an alternative to hypervisors that is better suited to such scenarios. The approach is a synthesis of prior work on resource containers and security containers applied to general-purpose, time-shared operating systems. Examples of such container-based systems include Solaris 10, Virtuozzo for Linux, and Linux-VServer. As a representative instance of container-based systems, this paper describes the design and implementation of Linux-VServer. In addition, it contrasts the architecture of Linux-VServer with current generations of Xen, and shows how Linux-VServer provides comparable support for isolation and superior system efficiency.},

However, the comparison of unikernels with other virtualization options regarding the concurrent provisioning of instances, as in the case of microservices-based applications, is still lacking.

abstract = {We propose a new memory-safe interpretation of the C ab-stract machine that provides stronger protection to benefit security and debugging. Despite ambiguities in the specifi-cation intended to provide implementation flexibility, con-temporary implementations of C have converged on a mem-ory model similar to the PDP-11, the original target for C. This model lacks support for memory safety despite well-documented impacts on security and reliability. Attempts to change this model are often hampered by as-sumptions embedded in a large body of existing C code, dat-ing back to the memory model exposed by the original C compiler for the PDP-11. Our experience with attempting to implement a memory-safe variant of C on the CHERI ex-perimental microprocessor led us to identify a number of problematic idioms. We describe these as well as their in-teraction with existing memory safety schemes and the as-sumptions that they make beyond the requirements of the C specification. Finally, we refine the CHERI ISA and abstract model for C, by combining elements of the CHERI capabil-ity model and fat pointers, and present a softcore CPU that implements a C abstract machine that can run legacy C code with strong memory protection guarantees.},

abstract = {Complete formal verification is the only known way to guarantee that a system is free of programming errors. We present our experience in performing the for- mal, machine-checked verification of the seL4 mi- crokernel from an abstract specification down to its C implementation. We assume correctness of com- piler, assembly code, and hardware, and we used a unique design approach that fuses formal and oper- ating systems techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first formal proof of functional correctness of a complete, general-purpose operating-system kernel. Functional correctness means here that the implemen- tation always strictly follows our high-level abstract specification of kernel behaviour. This encompasses traditional design and implementation safety proper- ties such as the kernel will never crash, and it will never perform an unsafe operation. It also proves much more: we can predict precisely how the kernel will behave in every possible situation. seL4, a third-generation microkernel of L4 prove- nance, comprises 8,700 lines of C code and 600 lines of assembler. Its performance is comparable to other high-performance L4 kernels. 1},

This has made microkernel development increasingly interesting. Different type of microkernels have been developed, ranging from kernels which merely deal with the hardware interface (Windows NT HAL), kernels especially for embedded systems (RTERMS), to kernels for multimedia streams and real time support (Nemesis) and general purpose kernels (L4, Mach). The common opinion that microkernels lead to deterioration in system performance has been disproved by recent research. L4 is an example of a fast and small, mlti address space, message-based microkernel, developed originally for Intel systems only. Based on the L4 interface, which should be as similar as possible on different platforms, the L4 Alpha version has been developed. This work describes design decisions, implementation and interface of the L4 version for 64-bit Alpha processors.},

However, today's virtualization stacks are unduly large and therefore prone to attacks. If an adversary manages to compromise the hypervisor, subverting the security of all hosted operating systems is easy. We show how a thin and simple virtualization layer reduces the attack surface significantly and thereby increases the overall security of the system. We have designed and implemented a virtualization architecture that can host multiple unmodified guest operating systems. Its trusted computing base is at least an order of magnitude smaller than that of existing systems.

It evaluates the exokemel architecture by measuring end-to-end application performance on Xok, an exokemel for Intel x86-based computers, and by comparing Xok's performance to the performance of two widely-used 4.4BSD UNIX systems (FreeBSD and OpenBSD). The results show that common unmodified UNIX applications can enjoy the benefits of exokernels: applications either perform comparably on Xok/ExOS and the BSD UNIXes, or perform significantly better. In addition, the results show that customized applications can benefit substantially from control over their resources (e.g., a factor of eight for a Web server).

abstract = {We desire, in general, a flexible, controllable intelligent communication network infrastructure, that can robustly support human activities in a large scale. Toward such SDN/NFV oriented network design, we start to seek for a good software router design in this paper. We introduce a software router implementation called “Kamuee”, which integrates DPDK, RCU, and Poptrie. In this paper the design principle, the architecture, and the software implementation status are explained. We show through the performance evaluation that 1) the performance figure of some hundreds giga bps is achievable by the use of commodity hardware, 2) the packet loss problem still remains as the severe problem to overcome, 3) Poptrie can handle very high-speed routing decisions for 40GbE wire-rate traffic, actually in a real IP router system. Kamuee implementation and its simple design principle are expected for various further applications. Examples include the development of high-speed middleboxes such as firewalls, CGNs, load-balancers, or massive scale routers handling quite a number of BGP and/or VPN.},

This library uses the services to generate the semantics of the Mach2.5/4.3BSD application programmers interface (API). This architecture makes Mach-US a flexible research platform and a powerful tool for developing and examining various OS service options. We will briefly describe Mach-US, the motivations for its design choices, and its demonstrated strengths and weaknesses.

abstract = {This paper describes the design and implementation of virtual memory management within the CMU Mach Operating System and the experiences gained by the Mach kernel group in porting that system to a variety of architectures. As of this writing, Mach runs on more than half a dozen uniprocessors and multiprocessors including the VAX family of uniprocessors and multiprocessors, the IBM RT PC, the SUN 3, the Encore MultiMax, the Sequent Balance 21000 and several experimental computers. Although these systems vary considerably in the kind of hardware support for memory management they provide, the machine-dependent portion of Mach virtual memory consists of a single code module and its related header file. This separation of software memory management from hardware support has been accomplished without sacrificing system performance. In addition to improving portability, it makes possible a relatively unbiased examination of the pros and cons of various hardware memory management schemes, especially as they apply to the support of multiprocessors.},

abstract = {We introduce cloud micro-elasticity, a new model for cloud Virtual Machine (VM) allocation and management. Current cloud users over-provision long-lived VMs with large memory footprints to better absorb load spikes, and to conserve performance-sensitive caches. Instead, we achieve elasticity by swiftly cloning VMs into many transient, short-lived, fractional workers to multiplex physical resources at a much finer granularity. The memory of a micro-elastic clone is a logical replica of the parent VM state, including caches, yet its footprint is proportional to the workload, and often a fraction of the nominal maximum. We enable micro-elasticity through a novel technique dubbed VM state coloring, which classifies VM memory into sets of semantically-related regions, and optimizes the propagation, allocation and deduplication of these regions. Using coloring, we build Kaleidoscope and empirically demonstrate its ability to create micro-elastic cloned servers. We model the impact of micro-elasticity on a demand dataset from AT{\&}T's cloud, and show that fine-grained multiplexing yields infrastructure reductions of 30{\%} relative to state-of-the art techniques for managing elastic clouds.

abstract = {We have created Zap, a novel system for transparent migration of legacy and networked applications. Zap provides a thin virtualization layer on top of the operating system that introduces pods, which are groups of processes that are provided a consistent, virtualized view of the system. This decouples processes in pods from dependencies to the host operating system and other processes on the system. By integrating Zap virtualization with a checkpoint-restart mechanism, Zap can migrate a pod of processes as a unit among machines running independent operating systems without leaving behind any residual state after migration. We have implemented a Zap prototype in Linux that supports transparent migration of unmodified applications without any kernel modifications. We demonstrate that our Linux Zap prototype can provide general-purpose process migration functionality with low overhead. Our experimental results for migrating pods used for running a standard user's X windows desktop computing environment and for running an Apache web server show that these kinds of pods can be migrated with subsecond checkpoint and restart latencies.},

We suggest a new fail-partial failure model for disks, which incorporates realistic localized faults such as latent sector errors and block corruption. We then develop and apply a novel failure-policy fingerprinting framework, to investigate how commodity file systems react to a range of more realistic disk failures. We classify their failure policies in a new taxonomy that measures their Internal RObustNess (IRON), which includes both failure detection and recovery techniques. We show that commodity file system failure policies are often inconsistent, sometimes buggy, and generally inadequate in their ability to recover from partial disk failures. Finally, we design, implement, and evaluate a prototype IRON file system, Linux ixt3, showing that techniques such as in-disk checksumming, replication, and parity greatly enhance file system robustness while incurring minimal time and space overheads.},

abstract = {Cloud computing offers a pay-per-use model and elasticity for hosted applications. The latter demands for decomposing an application into services, where each of them is executed by dedicated virtual machines. Typically, off-the-self operating systems (e.g., Linux) and managed runtime support (e.g., Java) are utilized thereby causing an unnecessary huge code base, resulting in a rather large attack surface. To address these problems, we present EsseOS, a platform for tailoring services as well as their associated runtime environment. EsseOS aims at reducing the attack surface by adapting the entire software stack that runs in a virtual machine to capture only the functionally essentially needed. This is achieved by following a clean-slate approach leveraging the advantages of Haskell, a functional programming language. We structure our software to be reconfigurable to remove unnecessary parts while still ensuring correct interaction between features by relying on Haskell's advanced type system. Initial results indicate an order of magnitude smaller code base for a tailored version of both Memcached and its execution environment compared to the original C-based version running on top of Linux.},

abstract = {Library OS (LibOS) architectures implement the OS personality as a user-mode library, giving each application the flexibility to choose its LibOS. This approach is appealing for many reasons, not least the ability to extend or customise the LibOS. Recent work with Drawbridge [29] showed that an existing commodity OS (Windows 7) could be refactored to produce a LibOS while retaining application compatibility. This paper presents Bascule, an architecture for LibOS extensions based on Drawbridge. Rather than relying on the application developer to customise a LibOS, Bascule allows OS-independent extensions to be attached at runtime. Extensions interpose on a narrow binary interface of primitive OS abstractions, such as files and virtual memory. Thus, they are independent of both guest and host OS, and composable at runtime. Since an extension runs in the same process as an application and its LibOS, it is safe and efficient. Bascule demonstrates extension reuse across diverse guest LibOSes (Windows and Linux) and host OSes (Windows and Barrelfish). Current extensions include file system translation, checkpointing, and architecture adaptation.},

abstract = {Library operating system (LibOS) is a userspace version of Linux kernel to provide an operating system personalization (or ad-hoc network stack) as well as yet-another virtualization primitive. Although the concept of library operating system is not new and was established in back to 90's, the idea here is adding a hardware independent architecture (i.e., arch/lib) into Linux kernel tree and reusing the rest of networking code as a library for userspace programs in order to avoid 'reinventing the wheel'. Unlike conventional Linux kernel/userspace model, system calls are redirected to the library in the same process or the other userspace processes, but the framework tries to be transparent so that all of the existing userspace applications like nginx and iproute2 are able to be used as-is. The LibOS framework provides several interesting use cases such as 1) a fast-path for the new protocol deployment (no need to replace or insert new kernel code), 2) a feature-rich network stack for a high-speed packet I/O mechanism like Intel DPDK, 3) a continuous integration for testing networking code implemented in Linux kernel tree. Right now, most of in-kernel protocols like TCP, SCTP, DCCP, and MPTCP are tested to work on top of the LibOS. Newly implemented protocol may also work depending on the POSIX API coverage and kernel glue code. This paper covers the introduction of the LibOS framework and two sub projects, Network stack in userspace (NUSE) and Direct Code Execution (DCE), with the internal design of the indirections, and presents the ongoing work on the multiprocess support to share a single userspace network stack (e.g., share a userspace routing table between two processes) via inter-process communication implemented by rumpkernel IPC/RPC framework.},

But, exploiting such dynamic resource availability and the often fluctuating markets for them requires agile elasticity and effective acquisition strategies. Proteus aggressively exploits such transient revocable resources to do machine learning (ML) cheaper and/or faster. Its parameter server framework, AgileML, efficiently adapts to bulk additions and revocations of transient machines, through a novel 3-stage active-backup approach, with minimal use of more costly non-transient resources. Its BidBrain component adaptively allocates resources from multiple EC2 spot markets to minimize average cost per work as transient resource availability and cost change over time. Our evaluations show that Proteus reduces cost by 85{\%} relative to non-transient pricing, and by 43{\%} relative to previous approaches, while simultaneously reducing runtimes by up to 37{\%}.},

Prism provides a filesystem service that allows lightweight creation of filesystems for new users from existing filesystems. All users' filesystems are mutable and yet isolated from each other. In our experiments, new filesystems can be created from existing ones in under one-fifth of a second. Prism is also designed to make centralized security-related services across multiple, similar filesystems more efficient. In particular, with Prism, tasks such as virus checking over multiple filesystem clones are much more efficient than scanning each user's filesystem independently. We describe the design of Prism and present performance results.},

abstract = {ARM servers are becoming increasingly common, making server technologies such as virtualization for ARM of growing importance. We present the first study of ARM vir-tualization performance on server hardware, including multi-core measurements of two popular ARM and x86 hypervisors, KVM and Xen. We show how ARM hardware support for virtualization can enable much faster transitions between VMs and the hypervisor, a key hypervisor operation. However, current hypervisor designs, including both Type 1 hypervisors such as Xen and Type 2 hypervisors such as KVM, are not able to leverage this performance benefit for real application workloads. We discuss the reasons why and show that other factors related to hypervisor software design and implementa-tion have a larger role in overall performance. Based on our measurements, we discuss changes to ARM's hardware virtu-alization support that can potentially bridge the gap to bring its faster VM-to-hypervisor transition mechanism to modern Type 2 hypervisors running real applications. These changes have been incorporated into the latest ARM architecture.},

abstract = {The KeyKOS nanokernel is a capability-based object-oriented operating system that has been in production use since 1983. Its original implementation was motivated by the need to provide security, reliability, and 24-hour availability for applications on the Tymnet{\textregistered} hosts. Requirements included the ability to run multiple instantiations of several operating systems on a single hardware system. KeyKOS was implemented on the System/370, and has since been ported to the 680x0 and 88x00 processor families. Implementations of EDX, RPS, VM, MVS, and UNIX have been constructed. The nanokernel is approximately 20,000 lines of C code, including capability, checkpoint, and virtual memory support. The nanokernel itself can run in less than 100 Kilobytes of memory. KeyKOS is characterized by a small set of powerful and highly optimized primitives that allow it to achieve performance competitive with the macrokernel operating systems that it replaces. Objects are exclusively invoked through protected capabilities, supporting high levels of security and intervals between failures in excess of one year. Messages between agents may contain both capabilities and data. Checkpoints at tunable intervals provide system-wide backup, fail-over support, and system restart times typically less than 30 seconds. In addition, a journaling mechanism provides support for high-performance transaction processing. On restart, all processes are restored to their exact state at the time of checkpoint, including registers and virtual memory. This paper describes the KeyKOS architecture, and the binary compatible UNIX implementation that it supports. 1.},

abstract = {Intel SGX hardware enables applications to protect themselves from potentially-malicious OSes or hyper-visors. In cloud computing and other systems, many users and applications could benefit from SGX. Unfortu-nately, current applications will not work out-of-the-box on SGX. Although previous work has shown that a li-brary OS can execute unmodified applications on SGX, a belief has developed that a library OS will be ruinous for performance and TCB size, making application code modification an implicit prerequisite to adopting SGX. This paper demonstrates that these concerns are exag-gerated, and that a fully-featured library OS can rapidly deploy unmodified applications on SGX with overheads comparable to applications modified to use " shim " lay-ers. We present a port of Graphene to SGX, as well as a number of improvements to make the security bene-fits of SGX more usable, such as integrity support for dynamically-loaded libraries, and secure multi-process support. Graphene-SGX supports a wide range of un-modified applications, including Apache, GCC, and the R interpreter. The performance overheads of Graphene-SGX range from matching a Linux process to less than 2× in most single-process cases; these overheads are largely attributable to current SGX hardware or missed opportunities to optimize Graphene internals, and are not necessarily fundamental to leaving the application un-modified. Graphene-SGX is open-source and has been used concurrently by other groups for SGX research.},

Application re-dimensioning can be implemented effortlessly, adapting the resources assigned to the application to the incoming user demand. However, the identification of the right amount of resources to lease in order to meet the required Service Level Agreement, while keeping the overall cost low, is not an easy task. Many techniques have been proposed for automating application scaling. We propose a classification of these techniques into five main categories: static threshold-based rules, control theory, reinforcement learning, queuing theory and time series analysis. Then we use this classification to carry out a literature review of proposals for auto-scaling in the cloud.},

As a compiler from LLVM to JavaScript, the challenges in designing Em- scripten are somewhat the reverse of the norm one must go from a low-level assembly into a high-level language, and recreate parts of the original high-level structure of the code that were lost in the compilation to low-level LLVM. We detail the methods used in Emscripten to deal with those challenges, and in particular present and prove the validity of Emscriptens Relooper algorithm, which recreates high- level loop structures from low-level branching data.},

If MittOS predicts that the IO SLOs cannot be met, MittOS will promptly return EBUSY signal, allowing the application to failover (retry) to another less-busy nodewith- out waiting. We build MittOS within the storage stack (disk, SSD, and OS cache managements), but the principle is ex- tensible to CPU and runtime memory managements as well.

abstract = {General purpose operating systems sacrifice per-application performance in order to preserve generality. On the other hand, substantial effort is required to customize or construct an operating system to meet the needs of an application. This paper describes the design and implementation of the Elastic Building Block Runtime (EbbRT), a framework for building per-application library operating systems. EbbRT reduces the effort required to construct and maintain library operating systems without hindering the degree of specialization required for high performance. We combine several techniques in order to achieve this, including a distributed OS architecture, a low-overhead component model, a lightweight event-driven runtime, and many language-level primitives. EbbRT is able to simultaneously enable performance specialization, support for a broad range of applications, and ease the burden of systems development. An EbbRT prototype demonstrates the degree of customization made possible by our framework approach. In an evaluation of memcached, EbbRT and is able to attain 2:08x higher throughput than Linux. The node.js runtime, ported to EbbRT, demonstrates the broad applicability and ease of development enabled by our approach.},

An AS topology represents logical connection relationships of networks, and thus, is independent of geographic locations of connections. However, the actual Internet topologies are constructed with geographical and physical limitations. In the meantime, the global Internet topology is shifting from a U.S. centered star topology to a more distributed topology interconnecting regional hub ASes. Therefore, regional topology views would provide new insights to understanding changes in the Internet structures. Our goal is to understand differences and similarities a-mongst Internet structures in regional views such as from Europe and from Asia. We examine inference method for regional AS topologies, and compare the resulting regional AS topologies. Our inference technique extracts AS boundaries with traceroute data collected from multiple vantage points. Then, we illustrate the resulting regional AS topologies using AS Core Maps in order to identify the degree structure and AS locations in each regional view. We show that the distributions of AS out-degrees similarly follow power-law but Tier-1 ASes play different roles in regions. We also identify issues such as the lack of vantage points in Africa and Oceania in the current data sets.},

abstract = {Commodity computer systems contain more and more processor cores and exhibit increasingly diverse architectural tradeoffs, including memory hierarchies, interconnects, instruction sets and variants, and IO configurations. Previous high-performance computing systems have scaled in specific cases, but the dynamic nature of modern client and server workloads, coupled with the impossibility of statically optimizing an OS for all workloads and hardware variants pose serious challenges for operating system structures. We argue that the challenge of future multicore hardware is best met by embracing the networked nature of the machine, rethinking OS architecture using ideas from distributed systems. We investigate a new OS structure, the multikernel, that treats the machine as a network of independent cores, assumes no inter-core sharing at the lowest level, and moves traditional OS functionality to a distributed system of processes that communicate via message-passing. We have implemented a multikernel OS to show that the approach is promising, and we describe how traditional scalability problems for operating systems (such as memory management) can be effectively recast using messages and can exploit insights from distributed systems and networking. An evaluation of our prototype on multicore systems shows that, even on present-day machines, the performance of a multikernel is comparable with a conventional OS, and can scale better to support future hardware.},

abstract = {Today's data centers utilized for cloud services represent a significant energy consumption and costs. Standard operating systems used for cloud instances are still designed largely to run on actual or emulated hardware, making them wasteful when being idle. Ideally, the cloud should be populated with leaner and more efficient operating systems. Unikernel operating systems are a good example of such, but most Unikernels are still not ready to be used in a cloud as they are built on specialized emulators. Furthermore, they are designed for single core operation and it is impractical to run hundreds or thousands of virtual machines for large workloads without straining the underlying cloud platform. The idea presented in this paper is to have all benefits of a lean Unikernel operating system while equipping it with multicore capabilities in order to represent an energy efficient and cloud-optimized operating system that can handle larger computations. IncludeOS has shown to be an extremely efficient Unikernel operating system, utilizing a much simpler event handler and foregoing the timer interrupt altogether. In our case, the experiments demonstrated increased performance for a multi-threaded processor intensive task compared to a classic operating system, thus showcasing a real-life solution for energy efficient computation in cloud environments.

abstract = {Nested virtualization, the ability to run a virtual machine inside another virtual machine, is increasingly important because of the need to deploy virtual machines running soft- ware stacks on top of virtualized cloud infrastructure. As ARM servers make inroads in cloud infrastructure deploy- ments, supporting nested virtualization on ARM is a key requirement, which has been met recently with the introduc- tion of nested virtualization support to theARMarchitecture. We build the first hypervisor to use ARM nested virtualiza- tion support and showthat despite similarities betweenARM and x86 nested virtualization support, performance on ARM is much worse than on x86. This is due to excessive traps to the hypervisor caused by differences in non-nested vir- tualization support. To address this problem, we introduce a novel paravirtualization technique to rapidly prototype architectural changes for virtualization and evaluate their performance impact using existing hardware. Using this tech- nique,we propose Nested Virtualization Extensions forARM (NEVE), a set of simple architectural changes to ARM that can be used by software to coalesce and defer traps by log- ging the results of hypervisor instructions until the results are actually needed by the hypervisor or virtual machines. We show that NEVE allows hypervisors running real appli- cation workloads to provide an order of magnitude better performance than current ARM nested virtualization sup- port and up to three times less overhead than x86 nested virtualization. NEVE will be included in ARMv8.4, the next version of the ARM architecture. Permission},

abstract = {As a central part of resource management, the OS thread scheduler must maintain the following, simple, invariant: make sure that ready threads are scheduled on available cores. As simple as it may seem, we found that this invari-ant is often broken in Linux. Cores may stay idle for sec-onds while ready threads are waiting in runqueues. In our experiments, these performance bugs caused many-fold per-formance degradation for synchronization-heavy scientific applications, 13{\%} higher latency for kernel make, and a 14-23{\%} decrease in TPC-H throughput for a widely used com-mercial database. The main contribution of this work is the discovery and analysis of these bugs and providing the fixes. Conventional testing techniques and debugging tools are in-effective at confirming or understanding this kind of bugs, because their symptoms are often evasive. To drive our in-vestigation, we built new tools that check for violation of the invariant online and visualize scheduling activity. They are simple, easily portable across kernel versions, and run with a negligible overhead. We believe that making these tools part of the kernel developers' tool belt can help keep this type of bug at bay.},

abstract = {Most operating systems provide protection and isolation to user processes, but not to critical system components such as device drivers or other system code. Consequently, failures in these components often lead to system failures. VirtuOS is an operating system that exploits a new method of decomposition to protect against such failures. VirtuOS exploits virtualization to isolate and protect vertical slices of existing OS kernels in separate service domains. Each service domain represents a partition of an existing kernel, which implements a subset of that kernel's functionality. Unlike competing solutions that merely isolate device drivers, or cannot protect from malicious and vulnerable code, VirtuOS provides full protection of isolated system components. VirtuOS's user library dispatches system calls directly to service domains using an exceptionless system call model, avoiding the cost of a system call trap in many cases. We have implemented a prototype based on the Linux kernel and Xen hypervisor. We demonstrate the viability of our approach by creating and evaluating a network and a storage service domain. Our prototype can survive the failure of individual service domains while outperforming alternative approaches such as isolated driver domains and even exceeding the performance of native Linux for some multithreaded workloads. Thus, VirtuOS may provide a suitable basis for kernel decomposition while retaining compatibility with existing applications and good performance.},

Running traditional operating systems in these virtual machines is a poor fit: traditional operating systems are not aware of changing resource prices and their sole aim is to maximize perfor- mance with no consideration of costs. Consequently, they yield low profits. We present nom, a profit-maximizing operating system designed for cloud computing platforms with dynamic re- source prices. Applications running on nom aim to maximize profits by optimizing simultaneously for performance and resource costs. The nom kernel provides them with direct access to the underlying hardware and full control over their private software stacks. Since nom applications know there is no single “best” software stack, they adapt their stacks' be- havior on the fly according to the current price of available resources and their private utility from them, which differs between applications.We show that in addition to achieving up to 3.9x better throughput and up to 9.1x better latency, nom applications yield up to 11.1x higher profits when com- pared with the same applications running on Linux and OSv. “And in this too profit begets profit.” (Aeschylus) 1.},

Three long-time FreeBSD project leaders begin with a concise overview of the FreeBSD kernel's current design and implementation. Next, they cover the FreeBSD kernel from the system-call level down–from the interface to the kernel to the hardware. Explaining key design decisions, they detail the concepts, data structures, and algorithms used in implementing each significant system facility, including process management, security, virtual memory, the I/O system, filesystems, socket IPC, and networking. This Second Edition • Explains highly scalable and lightweight virtualization using FreeBSD jails, and virtual-machine acceleration with Xen and Virtio device paravirtualization • Describes new security features such as Capsicum sandboxing and GELI cryptographic disk protection • Fully covers NFSv4 and Open Solaris ZFS support • Introduces FreeBSD's enhanced volume management and new journaled soft updates • Explains DTrace's fine-grained process debugging/profiling • Reflects major improvements to networking, wireless, and USB support Readers can use this guide as both a working reference and an in-depth study of a leading contemporary, portable, open source operating system. Technical and sales support professionals will discover both FreeBSD's capabilities and its limitations. Applications developers will learn how to effectively and efficiently interface with it; system administrators will learn how to maintain, tune, and configure it; and systems programmers will learn how to extend, enhance, and interface with it.},

Despite their usefulness, they come with a number of problems, many of which arise from the fact that they are hardware-based: they are costly, difficult to manage, and their functionality is hard or impossible to change, to name a few. To address these issues, there is a recent trend towards network function virtualization (NFV), in essence proposing to turn these middleboxes into software-based, virtualized entities. Towards this goal we introduce ClickOS, a high-performance, virtualized software middlebox platform. ClickOS virtual machines are small (5MB), boot quickly (about 30 milliseconds), add little delay (45 microseconds) and over one hundred of them can be concurrently run while saturating a 10Gb pipe on a commodity server. We further implement a wide range of middleboxes including a firewall, a carrier-grade NAT and a load balancer and show that ClickOS can handle packets in the millions per second.},

abstract = {The traditional " trap and emulate " I/O paravirtualization model conveniently allows for I/O interposition, yet it in-herently incurs costly guest-host context switches. The newer " sidecore " model eliminates this overhead by dedicating host (side)cores to poll the relevant guest memory regions and re-act accordingly without context switching. But the dedication of sidecores on each host might be wasteful when I/O activity is low, or it might not provide enough computational power when I/O activity is high. We propose to alleviate this prob-lem at rack scale by consolidating the dedicated sidecores spread across several hosts onto one server. The hypervisor is then effectively split into two parts: the local hypervisor that hosts the VMs, and the remote hypervisor that processes their paravirtual I/O. We call this model vRIO—paraVirtual Remote I/O. We find that by increasing the latency somewhat, it provides comparable throughput with fewer sidecores and superior throughput with the same number of sidecores as compared to the state of the art. vRIO additionally constitutes a new, cost-effective way to consolidate I/O devices (on the remote hypervisor) while supporting efficient programmable I/O interposition.},

abstract = {Numerous systems have been designed which use virtualization to subdivide the ample resources of a modern computer. Some require specialized hardware, or cannot support commodity operating systems. Some target 100{\%} binary compatibility at the expense of performance. Others sacrifice security or functionality for speed. Few offer resource isolation or performance guarantees; most provide only best-effort provisioning, risking denial of service.This paper presents Xen, an x86 virtual machine monitor which allows multiple commodity operating systems to share conventional hardware in a safe and resource managed fashion, but without sacrificing either performance or functionality. This is achieved by providing an idealized virtual machine abstraction to which operating systems such as Linux, BSD and Windows XP, can be ported with minimal effort.Our design is targeted at hosting up to 100 virtual machine instances simultaneously on a modern server. The virtualization approach taken by Xen is extremely efficient: we allow operating systems such as Linux and Windows XP to be hosted simultaneously for a negligible performance overhead --- at most a few percent compared with the unvirtualized case. We considerably outperform competing commercial and freely available solutions in a range of microbenchmarks and system-wide tests.},

This paper introduces several novel ESX Server mechanisms and policies for managing memory. A ballooning technique reclaims the pages considered least valuable by the operating system running in a virtual machine. An idle memory tax achieves efficient memory utilization while maintaining performance isolation guarantees. Content-based page sharing and hot I/O page remapping exploit transparent page remapping to eliminate redundancy and reduce copying overheads. These techniques are combined to efficiently support virtual machine workloads that overcommit memory.},

In this paper, we explore how PaaS vendors are using containers as a means of hosting Apps. The paper starts with a discussion of PaaS Use case and the current adoption of Container based PaaS architectures with the existing vendors. We explore various container implementations - Linux Containers, Docker, Warden Container, lmctfy and OpenVZ. We look at how each of this implementation handle Process, FileSystem and Namespace isolation. We look at some of the unique features of each container and how some of them reuse base Linux Container implementation or differ from it. We also explore how IaaSlayer itself has started providing support for container lifecycle management along with Virtual Machines. In the end, we look at factors affecting container implementation choices and some of the features missing from the existing implementations for the next generation PaaS.},

Our prototype, Haven, is the first system to achieve shielded execution of un- modified legacy applications, including SQL Server and Apache, on a commodity OS (Windows) and commod- ity hardware. Haven leverages the hardware protection of Intel SGX to defend against privileged code and physi- cal attacks such as memory probes, but also addresses the dual challenges of executing unmodified legacy binaries and protecting them from a malicious host.

abstract = {Performance of the operating system kernel is critical to many applications running on it. Although many efforts have been spent on improving Linux kernel performance, there is not enough attention on GCC, the compiler used to build Linux. As a result, the vanilla Linux kernel is typically compiled using the same -O2 option as most user programs. This paper investigates how different configurations of GCC may affect the performance of the Linux kernel. We have compared a number of compiler variations from different aspects on the Linux kernel, including switching simple options, using different GCC versions, controlling specific optimizations, as well as performing profile-guided optimization. We present detailed analysis on the experimental results and discuss potential compiler optimizations to further improve kernel performance. As the current GCC is far from optimal for compiling the Linux kernel, a future compiler for the kernel should include specialized optimizations, while more advanced compiler optimizations should also be incorporated to improve kernel performance.},

abstract = {BTRFS is a Linux filesystem that has been adopted as the default filesystem in some popular versions of Linux. It is based on copy-on-write, allowing for efficient snapshots and clones. It uses B-trees as its main on-disk data structure. The design goal is to work well for many use cases and workloads. To this end, much effort has been directed to maintaining even performance as the filesystem ages, rather than trying to support a particular narrow benchmark use-case. Linux filesystems are installed on smartphones as well as enterprise servers. This entails challenges on many different fronts. ---Scalability. The filesystem must scale in many dimensions: disk space, memory, and CPUs. ---Data integrity. Losing data is not an option, and much effort is expended to safeguard the content. This includes checksums, metadata duplication, and RAID support built into the filesystem. ---Disk diversity. The system should work well with SSDs and hard disks. It is also expected to be able to use an array of different sized disks, which poses challenges to the RAID and striping mechanisms. This article describes the core ideas, data structures, and algorithms of this filesystem. It sheds light on the challenges posed by defragmentation in the presence of snapshots, and the tradeoffs required to maintain even performance in the face of a wide spectrum of workloads.},

While OSes and applications have evolved tremendously over the last 25 years, POSIX, and the basic set of abstractions it pro-vides, has remained largely unchanged. Little has been done to measure how and to what extent traditional POSIX ab-stractions are being used in modern OSes, and whether new abstractions are taking form, dethroning traditional ones. We explore these questions through a study of POSIX usage in modern desktop and mobile OSes: Android, OS X, and Ubuntu. Our results show that new abstractions are taking form, replacing several prominent traditional abstractions in POSIX. While the changes are driven by common needs and are conceptually similar across the three OSes, they are not converging on any new standard, increasing fragmentation.},

IX uses hardware virtualization to separate man- agement and scheduling functions of the kernel (control plane) from network processing (dataplane). The data- plane architecture builds upon a native, zero-copy API and optimizes for both bandwidth and latency by dedi- cating hardware threads and networking queues to data- plane instances, processing bounded batches of packets to completion, and by eliminating coherence traffic and multi-core synchronization. We demonstrate that IX out- performs Linux and state-of-the-art, user-space network stacks significantly in both throughput and end-to-end la- tency. Moreover, IX improves the throughput of a widely deployed, key-value store by up to 3.6× and reduces tail latency by more than 2×.},

abstract = {Hosted hypervisors (e.g., KVM) are being widely deployed. One key reason is that they can effectively take advantage of the mature features and broad user bases of commodity operating systems. However, they are not immune to exploitable software bugs. Particularly, due to the close integration with the host and the unique presence underneath guest virtual machines, a hosted hypervisor -- if compromised -- can also jeopardize the host system and completely take over all guests in the same physical machine. In this paper, we present HyperLock, a systematic approach to strictly isolate privileged, but potentially vulnerable, hosted hypervisors from compromising the host OSs. Specifically, we provide a secure hypervisor isolation runtime with its own separated address space and a restricted instruction set for safe execution. In addition, we propose another technique, i.e., hypervisor shadowing, to efficiently create a separate shadow hypervisor and pair it with each guest so that a compromised hypervisor can affect only the paired guest, not others. We have built a proof-of-concept HyperLock prototype to confine the popular KVM hypervisor on Linux. Our results show that HyperLock has a much smaller (12{\%}) trusted computing base (TCB) than the original KVM. Moreover, our system completely removes QEMU, the companion user program of KVM (with {\textgreater}531K SLOC), from the TCB. The security experiments and performance measurements also demonstrated the practicality and effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Public cloud software marketplaces already offer users a wealth of choice in operating systems, database management systems, financial software, and virtual networking, all deployable and configurable at the click of a button. Unfortunately, this level of customization has not extended to emerging hypervisor-level services, partly because traditional virtual machines (VMs) are fully controlled by only one hypervisor at a time. Currently, a VM in a cloud platform cannot concurrently use hypervisor-level services from multiple third-parties in a compartmentalized manner. We propose the notion of a multi-hypervisor VM, which is an unmodified guest that can simultaneously use services from multiple coresident, but isolated, hypervisors. We present a new virtualization architecture, called Span virtualization, that leverages nesting to allow multiple hypervisors to concurrently control a guest's memory, virtual CPU, and I/O resources. Our prototype of Span virtualization on the KVM/QEMU platform enables a guest to use services such as introspection, network monitoring, guest mirroring, and hypervisor refresh, with performance comparable to traditional nested VMs.},

abstract = {A constrained optimization type of numerical algorithm for removing noise from images is presented. The total variation of the image is minimized subject to constraints involving the statistics of the noise. The constraints are imposed using Lanrange multipliers. The solution is obtained using the gradient-projection method. This amounts to solving a time dependent partial differential equation on a manifold determined by the constraints. As t → ∞ the solution converges to a steady state which is the denoised image. The numerical algorithm is simple and relatively fast. The results appear to be state-of-the-art for very noisy images. The method is noninvasive, yielding sharp edges in the image. The technique could be interpreted as a first step of moving each level set of the image normal to itself with velocity equal to the curvature of the level set divided by the magnitude of the gradient of the image, and a second step which projects the image back onto the constraint set.},

We demonstrate that while much has changed, the fundamental principles of minimality, generality and high inter-process communication (IPC) performance remain the main drivers of design and implementation decisions.},

abstract = {Cloud computing has evolved to meet user demands, from arbitrary VMs offered by IaaS to the narrow application interfaces of PaaS. Unfortunately, there exists an intermediate point that is not well met by today's offerings: users who wish to run arbitrary, already available binaries (as opposed to rewriting their own application for a PaaS) yet expect their applications to be long-lived but mostly idle (as opposed to the always-on VM of IaaS). For example, end users who wish to run their own email or DNS server. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach for cloud computation based on a process-like abstraction rather than a virtual machine abstraction, thereby gaining the scalability and efficiency of PaaS along with the generality of IaaS. We present the design of Picocenter, a hosting infrastructure for such applications that enables use of legacy applications. The key technical challenge in Picocenter is enabling fast swapping of applications to and from cloud storage (since, by definition, applications are largely idle, we expect them to spend the majority of their time swapped out). We develop an ActiveSet technique that prefetches the application's predicted memory working set when reviving an application. An evaluation on EC2 demonstrates that using ActiveSet, Picocenter is able to swap in applications in under 250 ms even when they are stored in S3 while swapped out.},

Towards this goal, we identify a number of required mechanisms and present early evaluation results of their implementation.

abstract = {In today's data analytics frameworks, many users struggle to reason about the performance of their workloads. With- out an understanding of what factors are most important to performance, users can't determine what configuration pa- rameters to set and what hardware to use to optimize runtime. This paper explores a system architecture designed to make it easy for users to reason about performance bottlenecks. Rather than breaking jobs into tasks that pipeline many re- sources, as in today's frameworks, we propose breaking jobs into monotasks: units of work that each use a single resource. We demonstrate that explicitly separating the use of different resources simplifies reasoning about performance without sacrificing performance. Monotasks provide job completion times within 9{\%}of Apache Spark for typical scenarios, and lead to a model for job completion time that predicts run- time under different hardware and software configurations with at most 28{\%} error. Furthermore, separating the use of different resources allows for new optimizations to improve performance.},

abstract = {Once compromising the hypervisor, remote or local adversaries can easily access other customers' sensitive data in the memory and context of guest virtual machines (VMs). VM isolation is an efficient mechanism for protecting the memory of guest VMs from unauthorized access. However, previous VM isolation systems either modify hardware architecture or introduce a software module without being protected, and most of them focus on the x86 architecture. This paper proposes HA-VMSI, a lightweight hardware-assisted VM isolation approach for ARM, to provide run-time protection of guest VMs, even with a compromised hy- pervisor. In the ARM TrustZone secure world, a thin security monitor is introduced as HA-VMSI's entire TCB. Hence, the security monitor is much less vulnerable and safe from attacks that can compromise the hypervisor. The key of HA-VMSI is decoupling the functions of memory isolation among VMs from the hypervisor into the security monitor. As a result, the hypervisor can only update the Stage-2 page tables of VMs via the security monitor, which inspects and approves each new mapping. It is worth noting that HA-VMSI is more secure and effective than current software approaches, and more flexible and compatible than hardware approaches.We have implemented a prototype for KVM hypervisor with multiple Linux as guest OSes on Juno board. The security assessment and performance evaluation show that HA-VMSI is effective, efficient and practical.},

This paper presents extensions to a programmable state machine, called B-FSM, which was initially optimized for string matching. These extensions enable direct support in hardware for essential regular expression features, such as character classes and case insensitivity. Moreover, they also allow the exploitation of regular expression properties that show up at the data structure level as common transitions shared between multiple states, resulting in storage reductions of up to 95{\%} for five NIDS pattern sets analyzed. Additional instruction support based on a flexible integration within the B-FSM data structure increases the processing capabilities and enables the scaling to larger pattern collections. The new IBM Power Edge of NetworkTM processor employs the B-FSM technology to provide scanning capabilities at typical rates of 20-40 Gb/s.},

abstract = {Library OSes are a promising approach for applications to efficiently obtain the benefits of virtual machines, including security isolation, host platform compatibility, and migration. Library OSes refactor a traditional OS kernel into an application library, avoiding overheads incurred by duplicate functionality. When compared to running a single application on an OS kernel in a VM, recent library OSes reduce the memory footprint by an order-of-magnitude. Previous library OS (libOS) research has focused on single-process applications, yet many Unix applications, such as network servers and shell scripts, span multiple processes. Key design challenges for a multi-process libOS include management of shared state and minimal expansion of the security isolation boundary. This paper presents Graphene, a library OS that seamlessly and efficiently executes both single and multi-process applications, generally with low memory and performance overheads. Graphene broadens the libOS paradigm to support secure, multi-process APIs, such as copy-on-write fork, signals, and System V IPC. Multiple libOS instances coordinate over pipe-like byte streams to implement a consistent, distributed POSIX abstraction. These coordination streams provide a simple vantage point to enforce security isolation.},

abstract = {This paper revisits an old approach to operating system construction, the library OS, in a new context. The idea of the library OS is that the personality of the OS on which an application depends runs in the address space of the application. A small, fixed set of abstractions connects the library OS to the host OS kernel, offering the promise of better system security and more rapid independent evolution of OS components. We describe a working prototype of a Windows 7 library OS that runs the latest releases of major applications such as Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, and Internet Explorer. We demonstrate that desktop sharing across independent, securely isolated, library OS instances can be achieved through the pragmatic reuse of net-working protocols. Each instance has significantly lower overhead than a full VM bundled with an application: a typical application adds just 16MB of working set and 64MB of disk footprint. We contribute a new ABI below the library OS that enables application mobility. We also show that our library OS can address many of the current uses of hardware virtual machines at a fraction of the overheads. This paper describes the first working prototype of a full commercial OS redesigned as a library OS capable of running significant applications. Our experience shows that the long-promised benefits of the library OS approach---better protection of system integrity and rapid system evolution---are readily obtainable.},

abstract = {NetVM brings virtualization to the Network by enabling high bandwidth network functions to operate at near line speed, while taking advantage of the flexibility and customization of low cost commodity servers. NetVM allows customizable data plane processing capabilities such as firewalls, proxies, and routers to be embedded within virtual machines, complementing the control plane capabilities of Software Defined Networking. NetVM makes it easy to dynamically scale, deploy, and reprogram network functions. This provides far greater flexibility than existing purpose-built, sometimes proprietary hardware, while still allowing complex policies and full packet inspection to determine subsequent processing. It does so with dramatically higher throughput than existing software router platforms. NetVM is built on top of the KVM platform and Intel DPDK library. We detail many of the challenges we have solved such as adding support for high-speed inter-VM communication through shared huge pages and enhancing the CPU scheduler to prevent overheads caused by inter-core communication and context switching. NetVM allows true zero-copy delivery of data to VMs both for packet processing and messaging among VMs within a trust boundary. Our evaluation shows how NetVM can compose complex network functionality from multiple pipelined VMs and still obtain throughputs up to 10 Gbps, an improvement of more than 250{\%} compared to existing techniques that use SR-IOV for virtualized networking.},

abstract = {The Linux kernel is a repository of high-quality, extensively reviewed and tested, but highly interconnected code. There have been several attempts to free this code and employ it to other uses, and, in each case, great amounts of resources were dedicated to decoupling the subsets that were needed from the rest of the kernel. Successful attempts faced significant maintenance issues, as small projects find themselves unable to keep pace with upstream kernel development. In time, differences between the extracted code and its mainline counterpart get bigger and it becomes very difficult to benefit from bug fixes, new features and improvements implemented in newer versions of the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel library (LKL) enables other projects to use code from the Linux kernel, without requiring them to isolate the needed pieces of code, separate them from other tightly knit components they may interact with, and extract them from the kernel. At the same time it allows LKL based applications to transparently make use of new features and bug fixes developed in the upstream version of the Linux kernel. Several proof-of-concept applications indicate that complete subsystems such as file system drivers or the networking stack can be easily used in applications running in environments as diverse as the Linux and Windows user space, or the Windows kernel space.

Such virtualized environments employ a virtual machine (VM) to execute an OS. While VMs can be defined by virtualized environments, they are defined to be the same as or similar to real hardware; thus, their interface to OSes also remain mostly unchanged. This paper describes a storage virtualization method that changes the VM's storage interface in order to make guest OSes lightweight. We implemented the proposed method in KVM, which utilizes Linux as its host OS. The evaluation results show that the method can improve the data access by comparing with the existing method.},

abstract = {Multiprocessor application performance can be limited by the operating system when the application uses the operating system frequently and the operating system services use data structures shared an modified by multiple processing cores. If the application does not need the sharing, then the operating system will become an unnecessary bottleneck to the application's performance. This paper argues that applications should control sharing: the kernel should arrange each data structure so that only a single processor need update it, unless directed otherwise by the application. Guided by this design principle, this paper proposes thre operating system abstractions (address ranges, kernel cores, and shares) that allow applications to control inter-core sharing and to take advantage of the likely abundance of cores by dedicating cores to specific operating system functions. Measurements of microbenchmarks on the Corey prototype operating system, which embodies the new abstractions, show how control over sharing can improve performance. Application benchmarks, using MapReduce on Corey performs 25{\%} faster than on Linux when using 16 cores. Hardware event counters confirm that these improvements are due to avoiding operations that are expensive on multicore machines.},

abstract = {The monolithic kernel architecture is significant in the real world due to the large amount of working and proven code. However, the architecture is not without problems: testing and development is difficult, virtualizing kernel services can be done only by duplicating the entire kernel, and security is weak due to a single domain where all code has direct access to everything. Alternate kernel architectures such as the microkernel and exokernel have been proposed to rectify these problems with monolithic kernels. However, alternate system structures do not address the common desire of using a monolithic kernel when the abovementioned problems do not apply. We propose a flexible anykernel architecture which enables running kernel drivers in a variety of configurations, examples of which include microkernel-style servers and application libraries. A monolithic kernel is shown to be convertible into an anykernel with a reasonable amount of effort and without introducing performance-hindering indirection layers. The original monolithic mode of operation is preserved after the anykernel adjustments, and alternate modes of operation for drivers are available as a runtime choice. For non-monolithic modes of operation, the rump kernel is introduced as a lightweight container for drivers. A rump kernel runs on top of a hypervisor which offers high-level primitives such as thread scheduling and virtual memory. A production quality implementation for the NetBSD open source OS has been done. The anykernel architecture and rump kernels are evaluated both against four years of real-world experience from daily NetBSD development as well as against synthetic benchmarks.

abstract = {It is generally accepted that the frequency bandwidth of human hearing by air conduction does not far exceed 20 kHz. However, some papers discussed the influence of extending the frequency by such high resolution audio formats on the auditory impression and brain activity. Studies on the bandwidth of human hearing are important for defining the frequency bandwidth for sound recordings and for developing electro-acoustic transducers, next-generation broadcasting systems and the definition of the recording format of audio archives. If differences of sound impression among high resolution audio formats indeed exist, it is necessary to consider two factors: influence of reproduction of very high frequency, and difference of sound quality in auditory frequency band among the sampling formats. Regarding the former factor, we conducted subjective evaluation tests concerning the influence of very high frequency components on the human perception in musical sounds. To make a precise evaluation, the test system was designed to exclude any influence from very high frequency components in the audible frequency range. Tests showed that the subjects could discriminate between musical sounds with and without very high frequency components.While, to study the difference of sound quality in the auditory frequency band among several high sampling digital recording formats, we also conducted subjective evaluation tests of perceptual discrimination among the following digital recording formats: 24 bit/48 kHz, 24 bit/192 kHz and DSD. The results showed no significant difference, namely, sound quality of the auditory frequency band in this experiment system does not depend on the sampling format. According to the results of these tests, extension of the frequency range by high resolution audio affects the perception of sound and it is caused by the reproduction of very high frequency components. It could be worth recording music by high resolution audio systems with a very wide frequency range. However various issues have been pointed out regarding the very high frequency band, i.e., the non-linear distortion of the amplifier or loudspeaker, time jitter and so on. Very accurate handling is required to reproduce the very high frequency components.},

abstract = {Performance of in-memory key-value store (KVS) continues to be of great importance as modern KVS goes beyond the traditional object-caching workload and becomes a key in- frastructure to support distributed main-memory computation in data centers. Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase of network bandwidth in data centers, shifting the bottleneck of most KVS from the network to the CPU. RDMA-capable NIC partly alleviates the problem, but the primitives provided by RDMA abstraction are rather limited. Meanwhile, pro- grammable NICs become available in data centers, enabling in-network processing. In this paper, we present KV-Direct, a high performance KVS that leverages programmable NIC to extend RDMA primitives and enable remote direct key-value access to the main host memory. We develop several novel techniques to maximize the through- put and hide the latency of the PCIe connection between the NIC and the host memory, which becomes the new bot- tleneck. Combined, these mechanisms allow a single NIC KV-Direct to achieve up to 180Mkey-value operations per second, equivalent to the throughput of tens of CPU cores. Compared with CPU based KVS implementation, KV-Direct improves power efficiency by 3x, while keeping tail latency below 10 µs. Moreover, KV-Direct can achieve near linear scalability with multiple NICs. With 10 programmable NIC cards in a commodity server, we achieve 1.22 billion KV operations per second, which is almost an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing systems, setting a new milestone for a general-purpose in-memory key-value store.

abstract = {This is a supplementary document for Chapter 1 from my book Mac OS X In- ternals: A Systems Approach. A subset (about 30{\%}) of this document ap- pears in the book as the first chapter with the title Origins of Mac OS X. This document is titled A Technical History of Apple's Operating Systems. Whereas the book's abridged version covers the history of Mac OS X, this document's coverage is considerably broader. It encompasses not only Mac OS X and its relevant ancestors, but the various operating systems that Apple has dabbled with since the company's inception, and many other systems that were direct or indirect sources of inspiration. This was the first chapter I wrote for the book. It was particularly difficult to write in terms of the time and other resources required in researching the mate- rial. I often had to find and scavenge ancient documentation, software, and hardware (all actual screenshots shown in this document were captured first hand.) However, I couldn't include the chapter in its original form in the book. The book grew in size beyond everybody's expectations—1680 pages! There- fore, it was hard to justify the inclusion of this much history, even if it is inter- esting history. I strongly believe that reading this document will help in understanding the evo- lution of Mac OS X, and, to some extent, of some aspects of modern-day op- erating systems. An important reality of technology, and of computing in par- ticular, is that many things that we think of as “new ideas” are not quite new. As Alan Kay once said, “Most ideas come from previous ideas.” This is also true in the case of Mac OS X. As one digs the past of Mac OS X and its predecessors, one begins to understand how ancient things influenced not-so-ancient things, and the fact that we owe what we have today to many more people than are usually credited. Please note again that this document is not the same as the book's first chapter. In particular, this document was not copyedited, composited, or proofread by the publisher. I prepared this PDF from my “raw” manuscript. Therefore, this document is not an example of the book's final typesetting or other production aspects. I hope you enjoy reading this document and the book. Just as this document provides a super-detailed history of Apple's operating systems, the book itself is super-detailed on the internals of modern day Mac OS X. It is not at all a book about using Mac OS X—it is about the system's design and implementation. Therefore, I expect it to appeal to all operating system enthusiasts and students.},

abstract = {In October of '86, the Internet had the first of what became a series of 'congestion collapses'. During this period, the data throughput from LBL to UC Berkeley (sites separated by 400 yards and three IMP hops) dropped from 32 Kbps to 40 bps. Mike Karels1 and I were fascinated by this sudden factor-of-thousand drop in bandwidth and embarked on an investigation of why things had gotten so bad. We wondered, in particular, if the 4.3BSD (Berkeley UNIX) TCP was mis-behaving or if it could be tuned to work better under abysmal network conditions. The answer to both of these questions was yes. Since that time, we have put seven new algorithms into the 4BSD TCP: round-trip-time variance estimation exponential retransmit timer backoff slow-start more aggressive receiver ack policy dynamic window sizing on congestion Karn's clamped retransmit backoff fast retransmit Our measurements and the reports of beta testers suggest that the final product is fairly good at dealing with congested conditions on the Internet. This paper is a brief description of (i) - (v) and the rationale behind them. (vi) is an algorithm recently developed by Phil Karn of Bell Communications Research, described in KP87. (viii) is described in a soon-to-be-published RFC. Algorithms (i) - (v) spring from one observation: The flow on a TCP connection (or ISO TP-4 or Xerox NS SPP connection) should obey a 'conservation of packets' principle. And, if this principle were obeyed, congestion collapse would become the exception rather than the rule. Thus congestion control involves finding places that violate conservation and fixing them. By 'conservation of packets' I mean that for a connection 'in equilibrium', i.e., running stably with a full window of data in transit, the packet flow is what a physicist would call 'conservative': A new packet isn't put into the network until an old packet leaves. The physics of flow predicts that systems with this property should be robust in the face of congestion. Observation of the Internet suggests that it was not particularly robust. Why the discrepancy? There are only three ways for packet conservation to fail: The connection doesn't get to equilibrium, or A sender injects a new packet before an old packet has exited, or The equilibrium can't be reached because of resource limits along the path. In the following sections, we treat each of these in turn.},

abstract = {Traditional operating systemslimit the performance, flexibility, and functionality of applications by fixing the interface and implementation of operating system abstractions such as interprocess communication and virtual memory. The exokernel operating system architecture addresses this problem by providing application-level management of physical resources. In the exokernel architecture, a small kernel securely exports all hardware resources through a low-level interface to untrusted library operating systems. Library operating systems use this interface to implement system objects and policies. This separation of resource protection from management allows application-specific customization of traditional operating system abstractions by extending, specializing, or even replacing libraries. We have implemented a prototype exokernel operating system. Measurements show that most primitive kernel operations (such as exception handling and protected control transfer) are ten to 100 times faster than in Ultrix, a mature monolithicUNIX operating system. In addition, we demonstrate that an exokernel allows applications to control machineresources in waysnot possiblein traditional operating systems. For instance, virtual memory and interprocess communication abstractions are implemented entirely within an application-level library. Measurementsshowthat application-level virtual memory and interprocess communication primitives are five to 40 times faster than Ultrix's kernel primitives. Compared to state-of-the-art implementations from the literature, the prototype exokernel system is at least five times faster on operations such as exception dispatching and interprocess communication.},

abstract = {We present our experience with QUIC, an encrypted, multiplexed, and low-latency transport protocol designed from the ground up to improve transport performance for HTTPS traffic and to enable rapid deployment and continued evolution of transport mechanisms. QUIC has been globally deployed at Google on thousands of servers and is used to serve traffic to a range of clients including a widely-used web browser (Chrome) and a popular mobile video streaming app (YouTube). We estimate that 7{\%} of Internet traffic is now QUIC. We describe our motivations for developing a new transport, the principles that guided our design, the Internet-scale process that we used to perform iterative experiments on QUIC, performance improvements seen by our various services, and our experience deploying QUIC globally. We also share lessons about transport design and the Internet ecosystem that we learned from our deployment.},
